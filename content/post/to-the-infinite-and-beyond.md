We recently achieved an incredible milestone in the ZÃ¼rich community of <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/zurich/" target="_blank">The Things Network</a> <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>: **we crossed the 100 gateway mark**!

Let me repeat that: there are more than 100 crowd-sourced gateways in Zurich providing open and free LoRaWAN connectivity to everyone around!

This is remarkable because it means that a comparatively small percentage of the population managed to organize themselves in decentralized way to provide solid infrastructure to the entire community! **And that is something to celebrate!**

*Kudos to the amazing community that is pulling this off!*
