+++
On the 2nd of April 2019 the Swiss Association of Telecommunication ([asut](https://asut.ch/asut/de/page/index.xhtml)) held their first IoT Conference in Bern titled “IoT From Hype to Reality”.

Many CEOs, experts and practitioners from different industries were part of the conference and shared their insight and knowledge.

The Open Network Infrastructure Association was part of this event, with a booth presenting [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), and professional IoT devices from companies like [Adnexo](https://www.adnexo.ch/), [Decentlab](https://www.decentlab.com/) and [Avelon](https://avelon.com/produkte/wisely/), the [LorixOne Gateway](https://www.lorixone.io/), as well as maker projects like [Storelytics](https://www.storelytics.ch/).

It was a great pleasure talking to guests and visitors and sharing the enthusiastic spirit of LoRaWAN open network infrastructure.

In summary, the entire day was a big success for our community and we are looking forward to expand the coverage of The Things Network here in Switzerland. At this point we want to thank our members supporting us and actively turning this IoT hype into reality.

Let’s keep building this thing together!
