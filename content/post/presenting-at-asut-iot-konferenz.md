Every day, the Internet of Things connects more and more devices, vehicles, buildings and infrastructure. It is estimated that in two years from now, there will be between 50 and 200 million connected **things** in Switzerland creating value for the economy and society.

Under the title `IoT: From Hype to Reality`, the ASUT IoT Konferenz brings together CEOs from leading companies, experts and practicioners, to show which trends, developments and impact are to be expected from IoT in the future.

We are very happy to be part of this event representing the open network infrastructure goals and achievements in Switzerland, as well as showcasing several devices and solutions both from the **professional sector** as well as from the **maker community**.

## Call for exhibitors
