## A short history

The Open Network Infrastructure association was founded on the 29th of August 2016 by a group of 23 amazing people representing ZÃ¼rich, Bern and Lausanne communities among others, with the purpose of promoting open network infrastructure.

On that evening, the executive committee of the association was formed and the **Articles of Association** were confirmed by all founding members.

Since our foundation, the articles have been updated during general assemblies and ratified by all active members.

The full text, including all history of changes, is open sourced on a Gihub repository and we encourage other organizations in Switzerland and elsewhere to fork and replicate this idea.
